üëã Hi there,

I'm Siphamandla Mjoli, a highly experienced software developer with a track record spanning over eight years in the industry. My journey has been marked by a profound involvement in the Web3 sector, where I've dedicated the past six years to making substantial contributions and closely observing its evolution since 2017. Additionally, I've pursued a part-time MSc in Data Privacy with a special emphasis on Zero Knowledge Proofs and Intel SGX, particularly within the context of clinical studies. While I'm currently on a brief hiatus from my studies, my commitment to learning and growing within the Web3 sector remains unwavering.
